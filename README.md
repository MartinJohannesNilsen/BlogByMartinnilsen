# Hello 👋🏼

Who? Well, my name is Martin Johannes Nilsen. I am a Norwegian Software Engineer. And if you want to read more about me, you might as well head over to [the very first blog post on the site](https://blog.mjntech.dev/posts/yjdttN68e7V3E8SKIupT).

What? This project is my take on a tech and development blog. This is supposed to be for me writing about topics I held close to my heart, such as 💻 Technology, 👨🏼‍💻 Coding, 🏠 Home Automation, and everything in between. I hope you will find the posts insightful, no matter how interested you are in all said topics.

How? This project is built with Next.js 14, and as of version 3 transitioned from the Pages to the newest App router architecture. As all of my frontend projects, I use TypeScript as the language of choice, and I tend to lean towards MUI as the design framework. For data persistence I chose to start using the free tiers of Firebase and Supabase, as everyone should do in the startup of a project, but have in version 3 transitioned to the use of containerized mongodb instances: one for production, and one for staging.

Enough talking, meet up at the landing page? [See you there](https://blog.mjntech.dev) :zap:
