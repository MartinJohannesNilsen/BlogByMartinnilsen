Hello 👋🏼

Who? Well, my name is Martin Johannes Nilsen. I am a Norwegian Software Engineer. And if you want to read more about me, you might as well head over to [the very first blog post on the site](https://blog.mjntech.dev/posts/yjdttN68e7V3E8SKIupT).

What? This project is my take on a tech and development blog. This is supposed to be for me writing about topics I held close to my heart, such as 🏠 Home Automation, 💻 Technology, 👨🏼‍💻 Coding, and everything in between. I hope you will find the posts insightful, no matter how interested you are in all said topics.

How? This project is built with Next.js and is the very first application I have built with the framework. Having some experience with React.js, I decided to take a chance on Next.js and Vercel for deployment. The code is written in TypeScript, the design framework is MUI v5 and the database/storage provider I use is Firebase.

Enough talking, meet up at the landing page? [See you there](https://blog.mjntech.dev) :zap:
